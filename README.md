This is the PostgreSQL extension package which provides functions that
calculate similarity between two strings.

## Synopsis

### `similarity(text string1, text string2, float limit)`

* _`string1`_, _`string2`_ — strings to compare
* _`limit`_ — minimum similarity of two strings

Calculate similarity of two strings _`string1`_ and _`string2`_. A value of
0 means that the strings are entirely different. A value of 1 means that the
strings are identical. Everything else lies between 0 and 1 and describes the
amount of similarity between the strings. Argument _`limit`_ that gives the
minimum similarity the two strings must satisfy. `similarity` stops analyzing
the string as soon as the result drops below the given limit, in which case the
result will be invalid but lower than the given _`limit`_. You can use this to
speed up the common case of searching for the most similar string from a set by
specifing the maximum similarity found so far.

### `similarity(text string1, text string2)`

* _`string1`_, _`string2`_ — strings to compare

The same as `similarity(string1, string2, 0)`.

## Installation

### Build and install the extension package from source tarball

To install **postgresql-similarity** extension type the following commands as
root (assuming that X.X is the version of a package):
```bash
tar -xvf postgresql-similarity-X.X.tar.xz
cd postgresql-similarity-X.X
make && make install
```

### Install pre-built binary packages

Pre-built binary packages for **openSUSE**, **Fedora**, **Mageia**, **RHEL**,
**CentOS**, **Debian** and **Ubuntu** are available at [openSUSE Build
Service](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aconcyclic&package=postgresql-similarity).

### Install the extension into database

To install the extension into database _`dbname`_ type the following commans as
root:
```bash
su postgres -c 'psql dbname -c "CREATE EXTENSION similarity"'
```

Test the extension:
```bash
psql dbname -c "SELECT similarity('similarity', 'distinction')"
```
```
    similarity     
-------------------
 0.285714285714286
(1 row)
```

To uninstall the extension type:
```bash
su postgres -c 'psql dbname -c "DROP EXTENSION similarity"'
```
